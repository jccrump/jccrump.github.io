                    <p>We see customers & partners ... not shingles! Well, I mean we see the shingles too, but you get the point.</p>
                    <p>Nimbus Roofing started because we have a vast knowledge in the industry and saw a gap in the market. Roofing contractors these days tend to chase the market or chase the storm and often times forget that they are dealing with real people and real families. At Nimbus Roofing, we always remember that we are here to help in a time of need when you have sustained damage to quite possibly your biggest asset. An asset that protects you and your loved ones. Because of this, we like to focus on building the relationship so you feel comfortable placing your house in our hands to repair.</p>
                    <p>Not only do we focus on helping to repair your home, but we also take great pride in the fact that Nimbus Roofing uses a portion of the profits to help those who cannot help themselves. We install roofs for free to those who may not be as fortunate. What this means is, you as the customer actually play a vital role in helping us do just that. When you partner with Nimbus Roofing, you are becoming part of the goodness that we are able to spread!</p>
